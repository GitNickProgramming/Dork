        "You are in a dungeon surrounded by a thick fog. As the fog settles, you see a figure standing in the center of the room. 
         They turn to face you, and a bright light shines down to reveal a horrifying beast.  It stands on its two hind legs and knashes its teeth. 
         It's chained to a post in the center of the room, there is a door behind him.  
         
         You turn to go back from where you came from but the door locked behind you. 
         
         You must get to the door on the far side of the room, but the beast is sure to attack."

        "Darkness surrounds you.  Your head is throbbing. You hear a faint voice shouting, calling out for help, 
        but you can't make out where it is coming from. 
        Where are you?! What happened?! You struggle to get to your feet and crack one eye open to look around. 
     
        The room you're in is spacious, bare with moss covered stone walls, dripping with crystal clear water. 
        How did you get here?!  
        You turn around to find a single door locked tightly behind you. 
        Did someone lock you in here?! 
        You'll need to find a way out. 

        There appears to be an access chamber, heading to a sewer to the east.  
        To the west, a dim light seeps through the cracks of a large ornate door. 

        To the north, there is a giant steel vault door... locked. 

        Suddenly, you hear that same voice scream, followed by the sound of manic laughter. 
        Then absolute silence. 
     
        Whatever that was, it was coming from behind the vault."

        "You turn the knob, and are surprised when it opens with ease. The room is dimly lit by a fireplace on the far side, 
        revealing shelves and shelves of old books. Torn pages, covered with dust, are scattered about the room. 
        The walls appear to have unidentifiable inscriptions on them.  
        
        As you get closer, you realize these inscriptions are written in blood.  
        The light of the fire reveals something even more unsual; On the wall above the fireplace is a single dagger.  
        As you inspect the dagger, you find that the blade is etched with the words, 'Scrum Lord'. 
        
        Perhaps you can find something useful in this room. 
        There is a simple door on the north side of the room, partially hidden by stacks of books."

        "You slide the heavy circular grate cover over just enough to get your body through the narrow chamber.  
         You make your way down a ladder until you step on the rough ground below. You are in a cave, with rock walls surrounding you. 
         You hear running water, possibly coming from up above. The cave you find yourself in continues to get smaller and smaller until 
         you have to crawl to avoid hitting your head. 
         
         As you continue through the small passageway, the sound of running water becomes more prominint. You reach a dead-end. 
         You quickly find that you're trapped and gushing water starts to fill the cave. 

         As you struggle to find a way out, you realize the rock walls to the north, crumble with the faintest touch. 
         You can break through the cave wall to the north, or you can fight the current and go west back to the ladder that leads to the first room."

        "Feeling tired and depleted you enter a small room filled with piles and piles of treasure, covered in a layer of dust. 
         A scroll sits on top of a podium.  There is a large skylight, and the ambient light of the moon shines upon the gold and silver 
         pieces.  It's quiet and restfull, and you see a latter leading to the surface. You are safe at last! You somehow managed to get out from
         the horrifying underground world you strangely found yourself in. Maybe you are indeed the ultimate 'Scrum Lord'."
