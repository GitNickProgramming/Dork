    "Darkness surrounds you.  Your head is throbbing. You hear a faint voice shouting, calling out for help, 
     but you can't make out where it is coming from. 
     Where are you?! What happened?! You struggle to get to your feet and crack one eye open to look around. 
     
     The room you're in is spacious, bare with moss covered stone walls, dripping with crystal clear water. 
     How did you get here?!  
     You turn around to find a single door locked tightly behind you. 
     Did someone lock you in here?! 
     You'll need to find a way out. 

     There appears to be an access chamber, heading to a sewer to the east.  
     To the west, a dim light seeps through the cracks of a large ornate door. 

     To the north, there is a giant steel vault door... locked. 

     Suddenly, you hear that same voice scream, followed by the sound of manic laughter. 
     Then absolute silence. 
     
     Whatever that was, it was coming from behind the vault."

        "You turn the knob, and are surprised when it opens with ease. The room is dimly lit by a fireplace on the far side, 
        revealing shelves and shelves of old books. Torn pages, covered with dust are scattered about the room. 
        The walls appear to have unidentifiable inscriptions on them.  As you get closer, you realize these inscriptions are written in blood.  
        The light of the fire, also reveals something even more unsual; On the wall above the fireplace is a single dagger.  
        As you inspect the dagger, you find that the blade is etched with the word 'Scrum Lord'. 
        
        There is no way out besides the way you came in. Perhaps you can find something useful in this room."

        "You slide the heavy circular grate cover over just enough to get your body through the chamber.  
         You make your way down a ladder until you step on the rough ground below. You are in a cave, with rock walls surrounding you. 
         You hear running water, possibly coming from up above. The cave you find yourself in continues to get smaller and smaller until 
        you have to crawl to avoid hitting your head. You continue to feel your way through a small passageway.
        
        The sound of running water thickens  "
